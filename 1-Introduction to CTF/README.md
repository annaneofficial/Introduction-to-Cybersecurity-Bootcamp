## What is a CTF Competition?

CTF (Capture The Flag) is a cybersecurity competition where participants solve challenges to exploit vulnerabilities and find a "flag" (e.g., `flag{example_flag}`) as proof of success.

### Types of CTFs:
1. **Jeopardy**: Solve challenges in categories like cryptography, reverse engineering, web security, and more to earn points based on difficulty.
2. **Attack-Defense**: Secure your network while attacking opponents' systems for points.
