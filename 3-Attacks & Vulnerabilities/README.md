## 🔑 **Cybersecurity Terminologies**

### 1⃣ **Cyber Attack**  
🔍 **Definition**:  
An offensive action to harm, steal, or disrupt a computer system.  

💡 **Key Idea**: It’s like someone breaking into your house digitally!

---

### 2⃣ **Exploit**  
🔍 **Definition**:  
A tool or technique used to take advantage of weaknesses in a system.  

📌 **Examples**:  
- Buffer Overflow  
- SQL Injection  
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  

💡 **Key Idea**: It’s the “method” attackers use to break in.

---

### 3⃣ **Cyber Threat**  
🔍 **Definition**:  
Anything that could harm your system or data, like malware or phishing.  

📌 **Examples**:  
- Malware  
- Ransomware  
- Insider threats  

💡 **Key Idea**: Think of it as a "dangerous possibility."

---

### 4⃣ **Risk**  
🔍 **Definition**:  
The chance of harm when a threat exploits a weakness.  

📌 **Formula**:  
**Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact**  

💡 **Key Idea**: Higher risks need quicker fixes!  

---

### 5⃣ **Vulnerability**  
🔍 **Definition**:  
A weakness in your system that attackers can exploit.  

📌 **Examples**:  
- Unpatched software  
- Weak passwords  

💡 **Key Idea**: It’s the “gap” in your defenses.

## 🕵️‍♂️ **Types of Exploits**

1. **Local Exploitation**  
   Requires physical or direct access to the system.  
   📌 Example: Plugging in a malicious USB.  

2. **Remote Exploitation**  
   Works over a network without physical access.  
   📌 Example: Attacking a vulnerable web server.  

3. **Client-Side Exploitation**  
   Targets user devices, often needing interaction.  
   📌 Example: Opening a malicious email attachment.  

4. **Server-Side Exploitation**  
   Targets servers without user interaction.  
   📌 Example: SQL Injection.  

5. **Social Engineering**  
   Tricks people into revealing confidential information.  
   📌 Example: Phishing emails.  

6. **Physical Exploitation**  
   Requires physical access to hardware.  
   📌 Example: Installing a keylogger.

## 🚨 **Common Computer Attacks**

1. **Phishing**  
   Tricks you into sharing personal information via fake emails or links.  
   💡 Example: "Your account is locked, click here to fix it!"  

2. **Malware**  
   Malicious software like ransomware, spyware, and adware.  
   💡 Example: A virus encrypting your files and demanding payment.  

3. **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**  
   Overloads a system with traffic to make it unavailable.  
   💡 Example: Crashing a website by flooding it with requests.  

4. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**  
   Intercepts communication between two parties.  
   💡 Example: Eavesdropping on a public Wi-Fi network.  

5. **SQL Injection**  
   Inserts malicious SQL queries to access databases.  
   💡 Example: Accessing user data through a vulnerable login form.  

6. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**  
   Injects malicious scripts into websites.  
   💡 Example: Stealing cookies through a compromised comment section.  

7. **Brute Force Attack**  
   Tries all password combinations until the correct one is found.  
   💡 Example: Automated password guessing.  

8. **Credential Stuffing**  
   Uses breached credentials to log in to multiple sites.  
   💡 Example: Reusing the same password across accounts.  

9. **Ransomware**  
   Encrypts files and demands payment to unlock them.  
   💡 Example: The infamous WannaCry attack.  

10. **Zero-Day Exploit**  
    Targets unknown vulnerabilities before they’re fixed.  
    💡 Example: Exploiting a flaw no one knows about.  

11. **Social Engineering**  
    Manipulates people into revealing sensitive information.  
    💡 Example: Pretending to be IT support to get passwords.  

12. **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**  
    Long-term, stealthy attacks aimed at stealing data.  
    💡 Example: Spying on a government network for months.  

13. **Insider Threats**  
    Employees misusing their access to harm the organization.  
    💡 Example: Selling sensitive data to competitors.  

14. **Session Hijacking**  
    Steals a user’s session to impersonate them.  
    💡 Example: Using stolen cookies to access accounts.

## 🔒 **How to Prevent Cyber Attacks**

🛠️ Keep systems and software updated.  
🔑 Use strong, unique passwords like `!Cyb3r-T4l3n75`.  
❌ Avoid clicking on suspicious links or emails.  
🔐 Use a VPN to prevent MitM attacks.  
🛡️ Install firewalls and antivirus software.
